							<h2>Childhood</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
							I was born and grew up in Jodhpur, Rajasthan. Early years were full of vivid
							moments playing tennis, diving into computer games like
							GTA and Need for Speed, and listening to music or playing cricket.
							Even back then, I dreamt of becoming an astrophysicist to uncover how the Universe works. 
							Tennis and hanging out with friends were my constant companions, and those experiences quietly shaped both my curiosity
							and my competitive spirit.
							</p>

						<!-- School years -->

							<h2>School years</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
							I attended St. Paul’s Sr. Sec. School in Jodhpur, where I loved science, maths,
							and history. School life balanced academics with athletics: I played tennis competitively 
							up to the national level and won several trophies, turning a hobby into a serious
							pursuit. Free time was mostly about enjoying moments with friends.
							</p>
							<p>
							I also faced a significant academic bump between grades 6–9, when mathematics was
							hard to grasp for me. That challenge felt tough in the moment, but getting through it
							taught me resilience and patience, skills that would matter far beyond those years.
							</p>

						<!-- College and higher studies -->
						<section class="post life-section" id="college">

							<h2>College and higher studies</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
							For my undergraduate studies, I chose to study BSc (Hons) Physics at Amity University, Noida. Early years of university were extremely rewarding 
							for me as I was finally studying the subject I always loved--Physics. During this time I was formally introduced 
							to Astrophysics and I instantly fell in love. Then I moved to Germany to pursue my MSc
							in Astrophysics from the University of Bonn. These decisions were a natural step towards the dream I 
							had since childhood. The hardest and most meaningful coursework came in cosmology and
							theoretical astrophysics during my master’s which was extremely rigorous, but deeply
							rewarding. I learned to wrestle with complex ideas and high standards, which
							pushed me to grow both intellectually and personally.
							</p>
							<p>
							Collaboration became a central part of this stage. I co‑authored two research
							papers, and one of them was a lead‑author paper based on my master’s thesis.
							Seeing that work come together was a proud milestone. Through these years I
							discovered something vital about myself: I was actually good at what I did,
							and that realization changed how I viewed my goals and capabilities.

							<h2>Current life and interests</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
							I’m now pursuing a PhD in astrophysics at the University of Rome Tor Vergata.
							My research builds on galaxy clusters and their observations in X‑ray and sub‑millimeter
							wavebands. Presenting my work, contributing to multi‑institution efforts, and even making new 
							discoveries have been part of the journey. Each one taking me back to my childhood fascination with the Universe.
							</p>
							<p>
							Day to day, I stay motivated by both the big questions and the practical steps
							forward: analyzing data, learning new methods, and working alongside peers and
							mentors who challenge me. The blend of persistence, curiosity, and teamwork that
							began in Jodhpur continues to guide me in Rome.
							</p>

						<!-- Looking ahead -->
						<section class="post life-section" id="ahead">
							<header class="minor">
							<h2>Looking ahead</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
							Looking forward, my goal is to keep pushing the boundaries of what we know about
							galaxy clusters, dark matter, and the large‑scale structure of the universe. The
							path from playing games in Jodhpur to doing cutting‑edge research today shows how
							curiosity, even when it feels impossible, can become a lifelong mission. Each
							challenge along the way is a chance to learn, adapt, and move closer to
							understanding the cosmos a little better.
